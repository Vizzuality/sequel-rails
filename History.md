* Make `rake db:schema:dump` load important extension

=====

* Make `rake db:schema:dump` generate a schema file which contains foreign_keys
  and uses db types instead of ruby equivalents. This ensure loading the schema
  file will result in a correct db

* Map some Sequel specific exceptions to `ActiveRecord` equivalents, in 
  `config.action_dispatch.rescue_responses`. This allows controllers to behave
  more like `ActiveRecord` when Sequel raises exceptions. (Joshua Hansen)
 
* New Sequel plugin added to all `Sequel::Model` which allows to use 
  `Sequel::Model#find!` which will raise an exception if record does not exists.
  This method is an alias to `Sequel::Model#[]` method. (Joshua Hansen)
